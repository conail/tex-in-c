It is natural to convert TeX from array indices to pointer. However, 
on 64-bit machines it means doubling the memory consumption (and 
on x86 slight slowdown). So, is elegance worth the cost?

TeX sting pool packs strings closely together. C prefers null 
termineted strings. Moreover, mantaininig string pool requiers 
external program. Should we convert TeX pool to null terminated 
strings or abandon it completely?

TeX boxes and friends have pretty similar layouts and uniform
set of operations. It looks very much like objects. Should we 
make object structure more explicit?
