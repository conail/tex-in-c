<html> <head>TeX in C </head>
<body>
This is <em>alpha</em> version of TeX converted to C. 
Archive with <a href="texinc-0.2.tar.gz"> current version </a>.
</p>

The source is intended to be pure ANSI C, so you should be 
able to edit makefile and just remake. For developement 
`perl' is needed. If you do not have perl you may still re-bulid 
using provided C files.</p>

Dvi files we get are different then dvi files from other 
TeX variants, mostly due to timestamp and size of output buffer. 
I wrote a little utility (<a href="dvinorm.c"> dvinorm.c <a/>) 
which should remove most inessential differences. There 
are still diferences due to glue ratio rounding.</p> 

Some <a href="Goals.txt"> ramblings </a> about this project.
The bulk of conversion is done mechanically using 'p2c'  
(<a href="Convertion.txt"> more on conversion </a>). 
Currently, however the C version is my master source.</p>

Currently path searching is very simple-mided: file are looked up in 
all directories in corresponding path. There are hardcoded
defaults (good for me to run trip test), but you probably 
shuld set real paths using environment variables (TEXINPUTS,  
TEXFONTS and TEXFORMATS for tex, tfm and format files respectively). 
Path searching has Unix slash hardcoded --- if neccesary change 
in source.</p>
